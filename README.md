#### Overview

This Python project focuses on analyzing Diwali sales data to gain insights that can be used to enhance customer experience and increase sales. The project uses various data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends and key metrics related to Diwali sales.Python and popular data science libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib. The project aims to gain insights into sales trends, consumer behavior and product performance during the Diwali festive season, enabling data-driven decisions for business improvement.

#### Data source

Data : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saadharoon27/diwali-sales-dataset/discussion

#### Project Description

•	Performed Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation.

•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn Libraries.

•	Improved Customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupations, gender, and age groups.

•	Improved sales by identifying the most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.

STEP1: DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING

Before start the analysis it's essential to clean and pre-process the data which includes handling the missing values, correcting the data type and dropping the null values etc.

STEP2: EXPLORATARY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis for understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.

• GENDER ANALYSIS

Compare orders and amount between genders.
Visualizing the sales distribution by gender using charts

• STATEZONE ANALYSIS  

Identifying the top selling states based on order count and total sales amount
Analysing whether certain states have higher preference for specific product category

• MARITAL STATUS

Compare the order & amount between married & unmarried customers

• PRODUCT_CATEGORY ANALYSIS

calculate the total sales amount for each product category using the chart

• STEP3: INSIGHTS AND TRENDS

  based on the EDA you can derive the several insights and trends
  
• GENDER-BASED INSIGHTS:

if there is significant difference in spending behaviour between the genders
identifying the specific product category that are more popular among the particular gender

• STATE-BASED INSIGHTS:

RECOGNIZE WHICH GEOGRAPHICAL areas contribute the most Diwali sales
Understand if any regional preference for the certain product category

• PRODUCT CATEGORY BASED INSIGHTS :

DETERMAINE the most popular category during the Diwali sales.anlaysing if there exits a co-relation between the total sales amount and the product category

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, we can draw conclusions about the demographics and preferences of Diwali sale customers. The code provides insights into gender distribution, age groups, popular states, marital status, occupation, and preferred product categories. This information can be valuable for marketing and sales strategies during Diwali sales campaigns.
